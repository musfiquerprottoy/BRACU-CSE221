# CSE221: Algorithm Analysis & Design - BRAC UNIVERSITY

Pre-requisite: CSE220

This course addresses the study of efficient algorithms, their analyses and effective algorithm design techniques. Standard algorithm design strategies, such as, Divide and Conquer paradigm, Greedy method, Dynamic programming, Backtracking, Basic search and traversal techniques, Graph algorithms, Elementary parallel algorithms, Algebraic simplification and transformations, Lower bound theory, NP-hard and NP-complete problems are discussed in the course. Examples of data structures and algorithms studied in details are Heaps; Hashing; Graph algorithms: Shortest paths, Depth-first and Breadth-first search, Network flow, Computational geometry, Minimum Spanning Tree; Integer arithmetic: GCD, primality; polynomial and matrix calculations; Sorting; Performance bounds, asymptotic analysis, worst case and average case behavior, correctness and complexity. The course includes a compulsory 3 hour laboratory work every week.
Course Objectives

a. Introduce students to time and space complexity of algorithms.

b. Teach students different sorting and searching methods and make them understand which is effective to use.

c. Make them familiar with different problem solving paradigms as described in the course catalog above.
